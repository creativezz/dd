    <p>We/ DudoTalk, are an internet based mobile phone application by M/s ZILJ TECH Private Limited, and this document uses the words “we” and DudoTalk interchangeably, and “you” and “users” interchangeably. The expression “we” covers both DudoTalk and M/s ZILJ TECH Private Limited, as and when the context allows.</p>

We obligate ourselves to maintain a no-leak and no-disclosure business as any private and sensitive data must receive proportioned protection. In our application, users and providers / ‘listeners’, are in control and can decide what they want to share and what they prefer to keep private.</p>
    <p>-   Any information you share with us by your own choosing is ‘redacted’, ‘obscure’, and ‘censored’ from everyone, including the employees of DudoTalk, as well as the external ‘listeners’ we bring in, for your engagement.</p>

    <p>-   We send promotional messages with an option to opt-out at any time.</p>
    <p>-   We do not share data with any third party, whatsoever.</p>

    <p>However, DudoTalk may, with your implied permission, use the basic information and data provided by you, to provide a more personalized online experience.</p>
    <p>DudoTalk stores any data entered by the user, in a very secured format deterring any leakage or misuse.</p>
    <p>No “sensitive personal data” is collected or stored and used as per the required legal guidelines. We emphasize and actively inform all users to avoid sharing any “sensitive personal data” with anyone related to, or connected to, or representing DudoTalk.</p>
    <p>The only purpose of collecting any basic or required information is to provide you with a more secure experience to the real-time users and enable the ‘listeners’ to address and engage the users, coherently and cogently.</p>
    <p>In general, you can visit DudoTalk’s portal without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when DudoTalk may need information from you. Only in such incidences, as disclosed, DudoTalk reserves the right to gather the information and use it according to the terms mentioned.</p>
    <p>DudoTalk does not rent, sell, or share personal or any other form of information about you to anyone, including non-affiliates, except to provide the services as agreed or intended to be generally provided through the DudoTalk application or any other service you've specifically requested, when DudoTalk has your permission.</p>
    <p>DudoTalk provides your redacted and censored information to unspecified listeners (as defined in the disclaimer) who timely engage with DudoTalk under strict confidentiality agreements and non-disclosure contracts.</p>
    <p>However, DudoTalk as per law, is legally bound to disclose information that any government organization with proper instructions from the court of law, in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>DudoTalk, as far as its publishing and online involvement is concerned, is only an intermediary as defined under the “Information Technology Act, 2000” and “Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021”, and does not modify and edit or in any way manipulate user-generated contents (if any), and therefore, is protected under law.</p>



    <h1>Information collected directly</h1>
    <p>DudoTalk may, at times, receive or collect some information to operate, provide, improve, understand, support, and market our services, including when you install, access, or use our services. The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our services.</p>
    <p>When a user enquires about, registers for, or uses our services, websites or application, then the mechanics of the system may need to procure (off course with your consent) some basic identification data - including your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, preferences (e.g. education you are interested in) and service usernames and passwords.</p>
    <p>DudoTalk is a portal which brings two individual set of parties at the same platform. Though we cannot be held directly or vicariously liable by conduct or disclosure of either party (considering we do not ask for any personal or typical information to be disclosed by either party or monitor the information shared at our mobile application), we do go to extra lengths to ensure your rights are protected and privacy is maintained at all costs.</p>
    <p>However, parties are bound to secure each other’s information in accordance with law and maintain each other’s privacy integrity, and ethics and are individually liable for any violations.</p>

    <h1>Your Consent</h1>
    <p>We've updated our Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what is being set when you visit our site and how it's being used. By using our app, registering an account, or making a purchase, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.
    </p>
    <h1>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to this Privacy Policy so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to this Privacy Policy and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Privacy Policy. If you do not want to agree to this or any updated Privacy Policy, you can delete your account.
    </p>

    <h1>Other policy issues</h1>
    <p>Parties are urged not to share sensitive personal information or core medical issues as DudoTalk is not a medical facilitator or in any way certified to practice medicine or advice professionally. While under our privacy policy if such information are shared by any party, this would be to their own volition and such data shall be protected as far as reasonably possible by us, however, we can not take responsibility for any information which the user may have chosen to share on DudoTalk mobile application on their own volition or otherwise.</p>
    <p>DudoTalk reserves the right to alter any of the conditions without prior notice to any of the parties. DudoTalk stays committed to protecting the data of both parties</p>
    <p>DudoTalk takes no responsibility and account for the consensual exchange of information between the real-time user and listeners (as defined in the disclaimer) and the post effect or events following with the sharing of the data between the parties.</p>
    <h1>Payments Data</h1>
    <p>When you use our services for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment account and transaction information include information needed to complete the transaction (this includes information about the payment method, amounts involved). If you use our payments services, our privacy practices are described below:</p>
    <p>When any party registers to use services making or giving payments, we receive your bank's name and confirm the bank account for use. If you do not have a BHIM UPI PIN already for your bank account, you can set one using your partial debit card number, expiry date, PIN (if required by your bank), and bank-issued one-time password (OTP) to set up a BHIM UPI PIN.</p>
    <p>We DO NOT RETAIN any user’s sensitive payment data (any debit card number, expiry date, PIN, OTP, or BHIM UPI PIN), as per law.</p>
    <p>We don’t have access to the BHIM UPI PIN because it is encrypted by Common Library (CL) software provided by National Payments Corporation of India.</p>
    <p>If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your payment information, we allow you to do that through your Payments settings or by deleting your account.</p>
    <h1>The extent of application services</h1>
    <p>Our services do not provide access to emergency services or emergency services providers, including the medical, police, fire departments, or hospitals, or otherwise connect to public safety answering points.

    <p>YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTIES ARE NOT MODIFIED BY THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER IF THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY OR TERRITORY OF RESIDENCE, APPLICABLE AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES, DO NOT PERMIT IT</p>
    <h1>Indemnification</h1>
    <p>If either the ‘users’ or the ‘listeners’ or any party on their behalf or a third party brings a claim (including a "Third-Party Claim") against us, in relation to any party’s actions in re.
